## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use U.S. Cancer Statistics to analyze the relationship between cancer data and U.S. Income Per Capita. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Topic
When first forming our groups for the Final Project, our initial thought was of working with a healthcare related topic and corresponding resources as some of our team members come from this background. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Goal 
The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning model that can determine what if any correlation there is between a citizens income level and their likelihood for an incidence of cancer. The model will indicate whether a higher income per capita will lead to a lower mortality rate. With this goal in mind, we expect to see a strong correlation between cancer survival rates and higher income per capita as well as a parallel between mortality rate and lower personal income.

## Resources
### 1. United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) 
[Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qDphhR6iy6LWQZMR-FTrf8-2vGju6G8aBF8bE3vS4zU/edit#slide=id.g1679ac1ab82_0_1689)
 
- Data Source: Center for Disease Control
- The preeminent source of data on cancer incidence is medical records. Medical professionals and staff at health care facilities pull data from patients' medical records. If the facility has its own cancer registry, they will enter the data there and send it to the national or state registry. Examples of these data sources include general practitioners office, radiation facilities, surgical centers and oncology laboratories.
- The cancer mortality statistics have been gathered based on information from death certificates filed within the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
 
### 2. United States Per Capita Income
[Link](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=2)

- Data Source: Bureau of Economic Affairs, Mid-Year population estimate by the Census Bureau.
- BEA produced intercensal annual state population statistics for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020. 
- BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta modified method to account for an extra leap year day.
- Per capita personal income is total personal income divided by the total mid-year population.
- Note: All dollar estimates are in millions of current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). Calculations are performed on unrounded data.
- Last updated: September 30, 2022--revised statistics for 2017-2021.
 
### 3. United States Smoking Percentages
[Link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261595/us-states-with-highest-smoking-rates-among-adults/)
[2018 adult smoking rate by state](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm#states)
[2019 adult smoking rate by state](https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/cigaretteuseadult.html)
[2020 adult smoking rate by state](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0176.pdf)

- Data Source: Center for Disease Control
- Adults who reported that they currently smoked every day or some days. 
- Percentages are weighted to reflect population characteristics.

## Analysis
Questions answered as a result of this analysis:
- Is there a relationship between cancer incidence and mortality rate to income?
- Do race and sex affect cancer incidence and mortality rate?
- Any unusually high or low rate of specific cancer type incidence rate by State?
- Any unusually high or low rate of specific cancer type incidence rate by Race?
- Which age range is most susceptible to lung cancer?
- Which states has the highest rate of skin cancer?
- 5 states with highest cancer rates?
- 5 states with highest cancer rates?
- What is the corrolation of smokers per state to lung cancer?
- Smoking is down but lung cancer is up?

## Machine Learning Model
What model we used and if it worked. KEEP IN MIND WE DO NOT NEED TO KEEP USING THIS MODEL!

### Lung Cancer Machine Learning Model Predictions
1) At 0.0% smoking rate, the lung cancer death rate would be 6.7 (intercept).
2) For every 0.2% of smoking rate increase, there will be an increase of 1 on deathrate. (coef)
