### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use U.S. Cancer Statistics to analyze the relationship between cancer data and U.S. Income Per Capita. 
### Initial thoughts section, what you're expecting going in

### Topic
When first forming our groups for the Final Project, the original proposal of working with a healthcare related topic and corresponding resources as some of our team members come from this background. 

### Goal 
The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning model that can determine what if any correlation there is between a citizens income level and their likelihood for an incidence of cancer. The model will indicate whether a higher income per capita will lead to a lower mortality rate. With this goal in mind, we expect to see a strong correlation between cancer survival rates and higher income per capita as well as a parallel between mortality rate and lower personal income.

### Resources
## 1. United States Cancer Statistics (USCS)

- The preeminent source of data on cancer incidence is medical records. Medical professionals and staff at health care facilities pull data from patients' medical records. If the facility has its own cancer registry, they will enter the data there and send it to the national or state registry. Examples of these data sources include general practitioners office, radiation facilities, surgical centers and oncology laboratories. 
- The cancer mortality statistics have been gathered based on information from death certificates filed within the 50 states, the district of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

## 2. United States Per Capita Income

GDP and Personal Income Data - WANT A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION ON THIS:

1/ Census Bureau midyear population estimate. BEA produced intercensal annual state population statistics for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020. BEA developed intercensal population

2/ Per capita personal income is total personal income divided by total midyear population. BEA produced intercensal population figures for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020 to create consistent time series that are used to prepare per capita personal income statistics. BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta method (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/intercensal/2000-2010-intercensal-estimates-methodology.pdf), modified to account for an extra leap year day, to produce the intercensal population figures that will be used until Census releases its official intercensal population data.

Note. All dollar estimates are in millions of current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). Calculations are performed on unrounded data.

### 3. United States Smoking Percentages

### Analysis
Questions answered as a result of this analysis:
- Is there a relationship between cancer incidence and mortalikty rate to income?
- Do race and sex affect cancer incidence and mortality rate?
- Any unusually high or low rate of specific cancer type incidence rate by State?
- Any unusually high or low rate of specific cancer type incidence rate by Race?
- Which age range is most susceptible to lung cancer?
- Which states has the highest rate of skin cancer?
- 5 states with highest cancer rates?
- 5 states with highest cancer rates?
- What is the corrolation of smokers per state to lung cancer?
- Smoking is down but lung cancer is up?


### Machine Learning Model
What model we used and if it worked. KEEP IN MIND WE DO NOT NEED TO KEEP USING THIS MODEL!
