### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use U.S. Cancer Statistics to analyze the relationship between cancer data and U.S. Income Per Capita. 

### Topic
When first forming our groups for the Final Project, the original proposal of working with a healthcare related topic and corresponding resources as some of our team members come from this background. 

### Goal 
The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning model that can determine what if any corrolation there is between a citizens income level and their likelihood for an incidence of cancer. The model will indicate whether a higher income per capita will lead to a lower mortality rate.

### Resources
## 1. United States Cancer Statistics (USCS)

The preeminent source of data on cancer incidence is medical records. Medical professionals and staff at health care facilities pull data from patients' medical records. If the facility has its own cancer registry, they will enter the data there and send it to the national or state registry. Examples of these data sources include general practitioners office, radiation facilities, surgical centers and oncology laboratories. 
The cancer mortality statistics have been gathered based on information from death certificates filed within the 50 states, the district of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

## 2. United States Per Capita Income

GDP and Personal Income Data - want more detailed explanation on this

### Analysis
Questions answered as a result of this analysis:
- Is there a relationship between cancer incidence and mortalikty rate to income?
- Do race and sex affect cancer incidence and mortality rate?
- Any unusually high or low rate of specific cancer type incidence rate by State?
- Any unusually high or low rate of specific cancer type incidence rate by Race?
- Which age range is most susceptible to lung cancer?
- Which states has the highest rate of skin cancer?
- 5 states with highest cancer rates?
- 5 states with highest cancer rates?
- What is the corrolation of smokers per state to lung cancer?
